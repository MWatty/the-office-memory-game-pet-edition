understand what is on offer without being inundated with information. Clear text and imagery are used to achieve this. 

#### Colour 

A palette of Blacks, Greys and whites are used with a pop of neon color in parts. The use of such colours is to reflect 
the theme of an office based environment. 

When choosing the colours i used the [Colour Picker Tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool)

theme of "the office". This was chosen using [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

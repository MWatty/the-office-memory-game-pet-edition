## UX 

### Strategy 

This website is for people of all ages and abilities, that are looking for a simple, free, easy to 
understand and easy to navigate game that tests your memory skills. This is going to be achieved by 
having a simple, minimalist layout and clear instructions on how to play. Visitors will want to come back 
time and time again to test their skills and assess how their improvements. 

### User Stories 

#### Visitor Goals 

* As a visitor, I want to understand the main purpose of the site. 
* As a visitor, I want the site to be simple to navigate.
* As a visitor, I want simple and clear instructions on how to play the game.
* As a visitor, I want to be able to play this game on all devices without impacting on quality.
* As a visitor, I want the site to be visually appealing.
* As a visitor, I want to have fun and have a sense of competition. 

#### Site owner goals

* As a site owner, I want this site to be responsive so that visitors can play the game on all devices. 
* As a site owner, I want visitors to find this site visually appealing.  
* As a site owner, I want visitors to enjoy the game and have fun. 
* As a site owner, I want visitors to have a sense of competition when playing with the aim of 
attracting visitors back to play. 

### Scope

* For users, the site owner wanted to create a website that is simple and inviting with a focus on playing 
and enjoying the game. The highlighted buttons act to draw the visitor in and quickly understand and get to 
grips with how to play the game. 

### Structure 

* In order to meet the expectation of "The Office Memory Game - Pet Edition" users the website aims to stick to convention 
in its layout and architecture.

* The website consists of 2 pages a landing page and a game page. There is a header section on each page, with a "The Office" 
heading. Clicking on this heading will take the user back to the landing page of the website and this is, as mentioned above, 
an expected and understood convention. 

* There is a large modal with highlighted buttons on the landing page, encouraging the user to understand and play the game. 

* All elements of the website are easily discoverable and aim to ensure that the user can get to their desired destination within 
3 clicks. 

* The colouring, theme and terminology used throughout the website is consistent. Returning visitors should feel confident to 
go directly to the game and play in a couple of clicks. 

* The website is interactive and provides lots of feedback to the user. This is evident in the use of the buttons on the landing page and 
of course, in the game itself with features including flip count, timer, sounds and scores. 

* The architecture of this website has been carefully considered with the user in mind and allows for ease of movement through the content. 

* Information on this section has been inspired by the information on [Code Institute](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/ci_program/diplomainsoftwaredevelopment)

### Skeleton 

All wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](http://balsamiq.com)

Please find full PDF versions of wireframes and sketches below:

* [Tablet Wireframe](https://github.com/MWatty/the-office-memory-game-pet-edition/blob/master/assets/wireframes/Wireframe%20-%20Tablet.pdf)
* [Desktop Wireframe](https://github.com/MWatty/the-office-memory-game-pet-edition/blob/master/assets/wireframes/Wireframe%20-%20Desktop.pdf)

### Surface 

#### Design 

* The overall design of the website is fun and simple. The site owner wants the user to simply navigate and 
understand what is on offer without being inundated with information. Clear text and imagery are used to achieve this. 

#### Colour 

* A palette of Blacks, Greys and Whites are used with a pop of neon colour in parts. The use of such colours is to reflect 
the theme of an office-based environment. 

* When choosing the colours the [Colour Picker Tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool) was used to assist.

#### Typography

* Courier Prime was chosen as this is a font typically associated with an office environment and marries well with the 
theme of "the office". This was chosen using [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

* font-family: 'Courier Prime', monospace;

#### Images 

* All images used throughout the website have been carefully chosen to ensure the theme of the game is maintained throughout. 
Of course, for the game itself the images are of pets and these pets add a fun element to the game, hoping to spark joy
in the user experience. The aim of the image use in the game was fun. 

#### Final Project Variations 

##### Navigation Bar 
* The navigation bar was amended from what was originally planned. 
* As well as the office home button, it was planned there would also be a contact and play tab. 
* However, these were removed from the website as deemed unnecessary, given there was a highlighted 'new game!' 
button in place to attract the user, duplication of this could be construed as confusing to the user. 
* The contact tab was also deemed unnecessary for the website and was removed. These changes have ensured that the user stories 
are met in that there is simple navigation and clarity throughout. 

##### Footer
* The footer was also paired back and kept very simplistic. 
* The return to top was not required as there was not a need to scroll far enough down the page to warrant a return to top button. 
* The links and social media links were deemed unnecessary for this game given the simple nature of the website. 

##### How to Play Modal 
* An additional 'new game!' button was added into this to ensure ease of navigation for the user. Without this feature the three 
clicks to the desired destination may not have been possible. This may have created an undue burden on the user in terms of navigation.

##### Click to Play 
* A click to play pop up was added to enhance the user experience, rather than go to 'new game!' and click on a card to start. 
The click to play overlay adds an addition interactive element and allows the user a little bit of time to understand and absorb 
the scenario before the timer begins. 

##### Exit Game Button 
* The exit game button has not been added as the user can click on the office home button in the navigation bar should they wish to 
exit the game. This seemed over burdensome on the user, when the home button is a well understood convention. 

##### Max Flips 
* The max flips were replaced with a flip counter that counts up to as many flips as the user needs within the minute provided. 
Having a timer and limit on the number of flips was decided to be unnecessary and a decision was made that a race against the clock 
was more appropriate for this game. 

##### Background Image on the Game Page 
* Given the images on both sides of the cards the addition of a background image was not required. This could potentially have created a 
distracting and over styled look to the page. 

##### You Win, You Lose Pop Up 
* The information provided within this was initially supposed to be within a square however it was decided that a blurred black 
background covering the entire page with the exception of the navigation bar was more in keeping with the design of the game. 

## Features 

### Existing Features 

* This website is responsive on all devices.

* There are interactive elements throughout the website.

* The website is categorised into two pages, a landing page and a game page. 

#### Landing Page

* Navigation bar as expected located across the top of the page, this acts as the Home button. 
* Central banner with a brief description of what the website is about, this also contains two buttons. 
* Button one 'how to play!' when clicked gives the user simple instructions on how to play the game and from here the user can click to play. 
* Button two 'new game!' takes the user to the 'click to play' game page where they can start their game. 
* The footer is a simple containing copyright information only. 

#### Game Page 
* This page consists of the navigation bar as above with 'the office' acting as a home button. 
* There is a countdown timer, counting down in 1 second intervals for 60 seconds or until the game is won. 
* There is a flip counter that iterates up by 1 as the user clicks or until the time runs out. 
* There are 16 cards that can be flipped, and the aim is to match all the cards in pairs in as little time as possible. 
* Should the player run out of time the game ends with a game over modal and the option of playing again. 
* Should the player win a winning modal pops up, again with the option of playing again. 
* There are also 3 buttons that allow the user to pause, play and reset the game. 

### Features left to implement 

* Levels - varying levels of difficulty would be added to the game to enhance the user experience. 

* Leaderboard - a leaderboard would be added to enhance the competitiveness of the game and allow for a more enhanced interactive user experience. 

## Technologies Used 

### Languages

* [HTML5](https://www.graycelltech.com/why-use-html-5/) was used as this is the latest Hypertext Markup Language and this is the standard language for describing the contents and appearance of Web Pages.
  All major browsers offer HTML5 support. 

* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) is used to define styles for web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

* [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/DEFAULT.asp) is used to program the behaviour of webpages.

### Libraries 

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used as this lends itself to quickly design and customize mobile first-sites.

* [Google-Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used to style the website fonts and ensure they complimented each other.

* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) used to create the wireframes. 

* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used to add font icons to the website. 

* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) was used to make the use of JavaScript on the website easier. 

### Version Control 

* [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) was used as version control in utilising [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) to add code, commit and push to [GitHub](https://github.com).

* [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) was used as this is an open source platform for automated and ready to code development environments that blends into your existing workflow.

* [GitHub](https://github.com) was used as a hosting platform for version control.

### Tools and Other Resources 

* [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/) was used to resize the images for optimum size for web use (max 798 x 1280).

* [TinyJPG](https://tinyjpg.com/) was used to compress the image files.

* [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) was used to edit pages and diagnose problems quickly. 

* [Browserling](https://www.browserling.com/) was used for cross browser testing.

* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) used as a general reference guide for CSS tips and Javascript function queries.

* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) used as a reference for online HTML, CSS & JavaScript tutorials 

* [Web Formatter](https://webformatter.com/html) used to correctly indent files. 

## Testing 

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project. 

* [WC3 Markup Validation Serivce](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) - [Initial Results with error](https://github.com/MWatty/the-office-memory-game-pet-edition/blob/master/assets/images/screenshots/SShtmlerror.png "Initial Results with error")
 & [Results with no errors](https://github.com/MWatty/the-office-memory-game-pet-edition/blob/master/assets/images/screenshots/SSHTMLval.png "Results with no errors")
* [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - [Results](https://github.com/MWatty/the-office-memory-game-pet-edition/blob/master/assets/images/screenshots/SSCSSValidation.png "Results")

JShint was used to detect errors and potential problems within the JavaScript Code. The only issues identified in JShint as per 
the results below related to the use of 'class',let', 'const' and the 'arrow function' which are only available in ES6, this is not a cause for concern. 

* [JShint](https://jshint.com/) - [Results Screenshot 1](https://github.com/MWatty/the-office-memory-game-pet-edition/blob/master/assets/images/screenshots/SSJShint1.png "Results Screenshot 1")

### Further Testing

* The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
* A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
* Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

#### Devices 

Tested the game functionality on the devices listed below: 

* Mac Book Pro 
* iPhone 11 
* Honor 10 
* Desktop 

#### Issues identified during testing 

##### Images 
* During testing it was observed that the images of the dogs were loading slower than expected. 
* To increase the performance of images I reduced the resolution and compressed them using tinyPNG.
* The images load as expected now. 

##### Card Back Icons 
* Paw and Black Tie icons were used on the card backs as a design feature. 
* During testing it was noted that all matches were a tie and a paw. 
* The tie image was removed and replaced with paws only, this removed the issue identified above. 

### Features Tested 

#### Navigation Bar / Home Button 
* "the office" acts as the home button and should take the game page to the home page. 
* This feature was tested and worked as expected 

#### How to Play Button / New Game 
* Clicking on the "how to play!" button should cause a modal to appear with basic instructions, this should then give the user 
the opportunity to play a "new game" or close the modal. 
* Clicking on the either of teh new "new game!" buttons should take the user to the "click to play" screen
* All buttons were tested and worked as expected. 

#### Overlay Text, Click to Play, Winning & Losing 
* The overlay features are expected to prompt the user to play and provide information to the user with regard winning and losing. 
* The overlay features were tested by clicking to play a game, winning a game and losing a game. The overlay features worked as expected. 
However, it was observed that with the overlays taking over the entire page there was no room for the user to exit the game should they wish to. 
As part of the user stories the game should be simple to navigate and there should be no entrapment of the user.
* To resolve this issue the overlays were amended so that the navigation bar is on display and the home button accessible. 

#### Card Game Cards
* As per the instructions it was expected that game should function as follows, users clicks on a card, this card has an image of a dog, 
user clicks on a second card this also has an image of a dog, if cards matched the images of the dogs stay, if not they flip back over. 
The user has to match all cards to win the game. 
* The expectation of the game is that the user cannot click on cards in certain circumstances including when a card is already flipped, when the game is paused and 
when checking for a match. 
* The game was tested on various devices and works as expected. 

#### Card Game Timer 
* The timer is expected to count down in 1 second intervals from 60. 
* The timer works as expected. 

#### Card Game Flips 
* The flip counter is expected to increase by 1 everytime a user clicks a card. 
* This worked as expected. 

#### Pause Button 
* The expectation is that the user can click the pause button should they need to. The user should not be able to flip 
cards whilst paused. 
* The pause button works as expected. 

#### Play Button 
* The expectation is that the user can click the play button following pausing of the game. 
* The play button works as expected. 

#### Reset Button 
* The expectation is that the reset button resets the timer and starts a new game for the user. 
* The reset button works as expected.

### Structure 

In order to meet the expection of "The Office Memory Game - Pet Edition" users the website aims to stick to convention 
in it's layout and architecture.

The website consists of 2 pages a landing page and a game page. There is a header section on each page, with a "The Office" 
heading. Clicking on this heading will take the user back to the landing page of the website and this is, as mentioned above, 
an expected and understood convention. 

There is a large modal with hightlighted buttons on the landing page, encouraging the user to understand and play the game. 

All elements of the website are easily discoverable and aim to ensure that the user can get to their desired destination within 
3 clicks. 

The colouring, theme and terminology used throughout the website is consistent. Returning visitors should feel confident to 
go directly to the game and play in a couple of clicks. 

The website is interactive and provides lots of feedback to the user. This is evident in the use of the buttons on the landing page and 
of course in the game itself with fetures including flip count, timer, sounds and scores. 

The architecture of this website has been carefully considered with the user in mind and allows for ease of movement through the content.

### Surface 

#### Design 

The overall desing of the website is fun and simple. The site owner wants the user to simply navigate and 
understand what is on offer without being inundated with information. Clear text and imagery are used to achieve this. 

#### Colour 

A palette of Blacks, Greys and Whites are used with a pop of neon color in parts. The use of such colours is to reflect 
the theme of an office based environment. 

When choosing the colours the [Colour Picker Tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool) was used to assist.

#### Typography

Courier Prime was chose as this is a font typically associated with an office environment and marries well with the 
theme of "the office". This was chosen using [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

* font-family: 'Courier Prime', monospace;

#### Images 

All images used throughout the website have been carefully chosen to ensure the theme of the game is maintained throughout. 
Of course for the game itself the images are of pets and these pets add a fun element to the game, hoping to spark joy
in the user experience. The aim of the image use in the game was fun.
